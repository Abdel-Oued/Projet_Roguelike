# Projet_Roguelike

This is an academic project carried out in the first year of engineering school at ENSTA Bretagne.
It is entirely programmed in python and the aim was to improve a roguelike game, which is a game
with ASCII graphics. It uses the TCOD (libtcode) library.

To play, double-click on main.pyw in your file system or execute main.pyw in an IDE !!!

Enjoy !!!

This game has been coded inspired by this great tutorial : http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/ .
