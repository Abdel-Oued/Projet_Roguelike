# Projet_Roguelike

This is an academic project carried out in the first year of engineering school at ENSTA Bretagne.
It is entirely programmed in python and the aim was to improve a roguelike game, which is a game
with ASCII graphics. It uses the TCOD (libtcode) library.

This game has been coded inspired by this great tutorial : http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/ .
